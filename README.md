Exactly âœ… â€” if you go with the **Serial override approach** I just explained, **you do not need to change your Arduino code at all**.
next chages 

Hereâ€™s why:

* Your Arduino code already handles reading RC channels, failsafe logic, and driving the motors.
* All you need is a way to **send control commands from Raspberry Pi** to Arduino.
* Arduino just needs to **read those commands via Serial** and replace its channel input values accordingly.

That means your Raspberry Pi code just has to:

1. Run your trained model.
2. Output the control signal (e.g., a steering value).
3. Send that value over Serial to Arduino in a format Arduino can parse.

Arduino will:

* Receive the value.
* Use it exactly like it would use a normal RC channel value.
* Apply its existing override and failsafe logic automatically.

### **Minimal example flow for Raspberry Pi:**

```python
import serial
import time

# Connect to Arduino
ser = serial.Serial('/dev/ttyUSB0', 115200)  # Change port to your Arduino

while True:
    steering_angle = get_steering_from_model()  # Your Carla model output
    ser.write(f"{steering_angle}\n".encode('utf-8'))
    time.sleep(0.05)  # 20 Hz control loop
```

### **Minimal example Arduino change** (if needed):

If you want Arduino to accept Pi control, you just need a tiny addition in `loop()`:

```cpp
if (Serial.available()) {
    int steering = Serial.parseInt();
    channelValues[0] = steering; // Override CH1
    channelActive[0] = true;
}
```

But â€” if you want to keep Arduino **unchanged**, you can even send a real RC signal from Raspberry Pi to Arduinoâ€™s RC input pin instead of serial, though this requires Pi generating PWM pulses (slightly more complex).

ðŸ’¡ Bottom line:
Yes â€” **you only need Raspberry Pi code** if you use serial override. Arduino code stays the same except maybe adding a small serial read block if you want direct overrides.

---

If you want, I can now **give you a working Raspberry Pi code example** that sends the steering signal to Arduino so your system works with your existing Arduino logic.

Do you want me to do that?
